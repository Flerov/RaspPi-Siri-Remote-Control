You can start your own written python scripts over voice commands from you iPhone.                                         
For that you have to create a note with Siri on your iPhone, the note will be scanned for specific keywords in your script.
When these keywords can be found the script will be executed by a thread which allows multiple scripts to run at once.     

!Everything gets explained in more detail in the Raspi-Remote-Control folder!
